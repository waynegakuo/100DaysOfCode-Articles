        <p>JSON Web Token, famously known as <b>JWT</b>, are used for <b>authorization</b> & <b>NOT</b>
            <b>authentication</b></p>
        <p><b>Authentication: </b>Logging in a user ~ use of username & passowrd</p>
        <p><b>Authorization: </b>Esnuring that the the user sending requests to your server is the same user that logged
            in
            during the authentication process</p>
        <p>This is done using JWT</p>
        <img src="jwt.png" alt="JWT Explained" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;">
        <br>
        <p>The token created has the user's information in it in encoded form</p>
        <p><b>Heder.Payload.SecretKey</b></p>

        <p>In JWT, we can use one token to be able to be authorized in another server, say of the same organization</p>
        <img src="jwt2.png" alt="JWT Explained" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;">
        <p>When logging into server 1, as usual, the token is created and the token sent to the client to be stored. The
            user can use this token to access information say from server 2 since they belong to the same organization
        </p>
        <p><b>How?</b></p>
        <p>The <b>secret key</b> used to generate the token is usually stored in the servers. The same secret key can
            also
            be stored in another server especially cases where you'd want to have the users have seamless authorization
            in
            accessing certain resources</p>
        <p>When a request is sent to the server, the secret key is used to decrypt the the token since it's the same key
            that was used to encrypt it during login. The same token (since it's stored on the client side) can be used
            to
            access information in the other server, as long as the other server has the same secret key.</p>
        <p>The token can be destroyed or expire based on the EAT(Expired At) specified in the payload</p>

        <p>Use cases can also be when the company has too many users and therefore has various servers in case there
            could be high data traffic. The <b>Load Balancers</b> would kick in and reroute other users to the second
            server but will still be able to access information due to fast authorization due to having the token on the
            client </p>
